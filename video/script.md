## Demo script
The OpenHealth Patient Portal showcases seamless data integration powered by the OpenHealth API. It allows the migration of health records from various providers—such as local hospitals and pharmacies—through a simple service registration process.

By searching a patient's NHI number, users can access comprehensive medical data maintained across multiple networks and providers.

Leveraging AI, the portal can generate a summarized patient overview. An AI assistant is also available to help users quickly navigate patient records, confirm medication dosages, and reference relevant clinical information through follow-up questions.
