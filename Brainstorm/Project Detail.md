# Project Description
OpenHealth API aims to connect the disjointed health care data landscape for individuals, healthcare providers and governments.

## Need for Phase 1
- Currently patient health data access can be limited depending on location and service providers
- Health care provider having greater access to patient health information leads to better health outcome (1)
- Having a singular access point can reduce administration time from manually requesting health care information from other providers

## Need for Phase 2
- Central database allows data to be more easily managed

## Need for Phase 3
-	Improved health literacy (Health Status Report 2023)
-	Making health services more accessible can reduce inequalities for Māori who have lower accessibility

## Measurement of Outcome
-	Hospital discharge data (rate of hospitalisation, mortality
