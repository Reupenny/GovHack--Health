Project name: OpenHealth API

Description: OpenHealth API transforms healthcare decision-making by connecting New Zealand's fragmented health data landscape. Our platform empowers healthcare providers with instant access
to comprehensive patient information, enabling better care outcomes through intelligent data integration and AI-powered insights.

Key Features:

• Unified Data Access: Integrates data from hospitals, GP clinics, pharmacies, laboratories, and specialists into a single platform
• AI-Powered Insights: Intelligent analysis highlights critical information, drug interactions, and treatment patterns
• Real-Time Updates: Instant access to test results and medical records across all providers
• Multi-User Support: Serves doctors, nurses, pharmacists, patients, and government agencies

Impact: Addresses critical healthcare challenges where clinicians report missing information in 13.6% of visits, with providers spending up to 10+ minutes unsuccessfully searching for patient
data. Our solution reduces administrative burden, improves patient safety, and enhances health equity—particularly benefiting Māori communities with improved healthcare accessibility.

Data story: Healthcare providers face a critical challenge: essential patient information is scattered across disconnected systems. Research shows clinicians encounter missing clinical
information in 13.6% of visits, including laboratory results (6.1%), radiology results (3.8%), and medication history (3.2%). This fragmentation leads to:

• Time Waste: 25.6% of searches take 5-10 minutes, with 10.4% exceeding 10 minutes
• Patient Risk: 44% of missing information cases are likely to adversely affect patients
• Care Delays: 59.5% of cases potentially result in delayed care or additional services

Our Solution: OpenHealth API creates a unified data ecosystem connecting public hospitals, private specialists, GP clinics, pharmacies, and laboratories. By centralizing access to patient
records, we enable:

• Emergency Care: Dr. Williams in Christchurch can instantly access North Island patient records during critical situations
• Mental Health: Dr. Sharma can correlate physical and mental health data for comprehensive treatment plans
• Rural Access: Patients like Sarah McKenzie can access their health records regardless of provider affiliations
• Public Health: Epidemiologists can monitor disease patterns and implement early intervention strategies

Measurable Outcomes: Reduction in hospital readmission rates, decreased diagnostic delays, improved medication adherence, and enhanced health equity metrics—particularly for Māori populations
who face accessibility barriers.
